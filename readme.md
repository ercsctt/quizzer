# Quizzer
Quizzer is a PHP CMS written for BCS, the task was to write a CMS capable of managing quiz content (quizzes, questions and answers).

This was written as-per-spec of BCS, and isn't really supposed to be used in a commercial project. You can use it and modify it to your heart's content, though.
